"""Mail Client API - Core protocols and contracts.

This module defines the core protocols (interfaces) for the mail client system.
It provides abstract contracts that concrete implementations must follow to
enable email retrieval, message management, and client operations.

Usage:
    from mail_client_api import get_client, Client

    # Get a client instance from an implementation
    client = get_client()  # Returns concrete implementation

    # Use the client to fetch messages
    messages = client.get_messages()
    for message in messages:
        print(f"Subject: {message.subject}")
