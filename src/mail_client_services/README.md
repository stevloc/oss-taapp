# Overview 
The `mail_client_service` package provides a FastAPI application that serves as a network wrapper for the core mail client functionality. This service is a unit of deployment and runtime execution , exposing the mail client's capabilities via a REST API.

This service operates as a thin wrapper around the components already built, using the existing `mail_client_api.get_client()` factory to obtain a client instance without re-implementing any business logic. 

# Purpose 
This package serves as the service layer for the email assistant system:
-**REST API Exposure**: Exposes client operations via standard RESTful endpoints.
-**Thin Wrapper**: Uses the injected client implementation and translates client method calls into network requests.
-**Location Transparency**: Allows the system to operate regardless of whether the mail client is a local library or a remote service
